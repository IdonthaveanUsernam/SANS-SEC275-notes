*COMPUTER HARDWARE*

-motherboard: central piece who connect all the components of the computer 
    -sockets: kind of connector that the CPU processor has to connect with the motherboard
    -buses: connect and move data between components

-Processor: (CPU) is responsible for executing instructions contained in computer programs
    -cores: is responsible for executings instructions (modern CPU may have multiples cores to perform tasks simultaneously)
    -clock Speed: A measure of how many CPU cycles can be performed in a second 
    -context switching: for single core processor the processor share processor time between applications

-RAM: (random access memory) determine the number of actions you can perform at once
    -speed: RAM is fast to read, so data often go into RAM for faster manipulation for the Processor
