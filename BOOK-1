*COMPUTER HARDWARE*

-motherboard: central piece who connect all the components of the computer 
    -sockets: kind of connector that the CPU processor has to connect with the motherboard
    -buses: connect and move data between components

-Processor: (CPU) is responsible for executing instructions contained in computer programs
    -cores: is responsible for executings instructions (modern CPU may have multiples cores to perform tasks simultaneously)
    -clock Speed: A measure of how many CPU cycles can be performed in a second 
    -context switching: for single core processor the processor share processor time between applications

-RAM: (random access memory) determine the number of actions you can perform at once
    -speed: RAM is fast to read, so data often go into RAM for faster manipulation for the Processor
    -Volatility: The data stored in the RAM is deleted when the computer is shutdown
    -Compatibility DDR# stand for double data rate with the #(3,4,5) meaning the generation. Speed of RAM is measured in MHz
        So, pay  attention of what generation and speed you motherboard is compatible with

-Types of storage: Storage is a components that provides data storage usually a hard drive or a SSD (solid state drive)
    -Size: storage can have a different size usually they are smaller for laptop
    -Capacity: each drive has a maximum capacity (usually drive have a real capacity bellow than their advertised value like 3.8TB for a presumly 4TB of data)
    -Mechanical vs solid state: Mechanical are usually slow and less reliable over long period of time thant Solid state.
        Solid state contains no moving part unlike mechanical and are more reliable and faster than mechanical drive.

-GPU (Graphcs Proccessing Unit), it's kind of processor that excel at number crunching
    -Number crunching: CPU excel at task that involver mathematical operations such a 3D rendering or encryption

-USB: common way of connecting an input device (Universal Serial Bus) their are several generation of USB who can Transfer data with less or more speed

-PS/2: old peripherals support

-Output Devices: devices that accept data from a computer (monitor, printer, etc..)
    -VGA: Old stuff for A/V output
    -DVI: newer than VGA but a bit old today
    -HDMI: more modern and the standar to this day and can also transmit video and audio
    -Display Port: young brother of HDMI
    -USB-C: have a wider ranger of capabilities

-Heat sinks: they are devices who purpose is to move away heat from the critical component

-Power supply: PSU (Power supply unit) are taking power and delivering it to the computer components
