*COMPUTER HARDWARE*

-motherboard: central piece who connect all the components of the computer 
    -sockets: kind of connector that the CPU processor has to connect with the motherboard
    -buses: connect and move data between components

-Processor: (CPU) is responsible for executing instructions contained in computer programs
    -cores: is responsible for executings instructions (modern CPU may have multiples cores to perform tasks simultaneously)
    -clock Speed: A measure of how many CPU cycles can be performed in a second 
    -context switching: for single core processor the processor share processor time between applications

-RAM: (random access memory) determine the number of actions you can perform at once
    -speed: RAM is fast to read, so data often go into RAM for faster manipulation for the Processor
    -Volatility: The data stored in the RAM is deleted when the computer is shutdown
    -Compatibility DDR# stand for double data rate with the #(3,4,5) meaning the generation. Speed of RAM is measured in MHz
        So, pay  attention of what generation and speed you motherboard is compatible with

-Types of storage: Storage is a components that provides data storage usually a hard drive or a SSD (solid state drive)
    -Size: storage can have a different size usually they are smaller for laptop
    -Capacity: each drive has a maximum capacity (usually drive have a real capacity bellow than their advertised value like 3.8TB for a presumly 4TB of data)
    -Mechanical vs solid state: Mechanical are usually slow and less reliable over long period of time thant Solid state.
        Solid state contains no moving part unlike mechanical and are more reliable and faster than mechanical drive.

-GPU (Graphcs Proccessing Unit), it's kind of processor that excel at number crunching
    -Number crunching: CPU excel at task that involver mathematical operations such a 3D rendering or encryption

-USB: common way of connecting an input device (Universal Serial Bus) their are several generation of USB who can Transfer data with less or more speed

-PS/2: old peripherals support

-Output Devices: devices that accept data from a computer (monitor, printer, etc..)
    -VGA: Old stuff for A/V output
    -DVI: newer than VGA but a bit old today
    -HDMI: more modern and the standar to this day and can also transmit video and audio
    -Display Port: young brother of HDMI
    -USB-C: have a wider ranger of capabilities

-Heat sinks: they are devices who purpose is to move away heat from the critical component

-Power supply: PSU (Power supply unit) are taking power and delivering it to the computer components




*DATA STORAGE AND REPRESENTATION*

-Bits & Bytes: a bit is 0 or 1 it's known as a boolean value with 1 is on and 0 is off. All data in computer are made of bits
    - Byte = 8 bits
    - Kilobytes = 1000 bytes
    -megabyte = 1000 kilobytes
    - gigabyte = 1000 megabytes
    - terabyte = 1000 gigabytes
alternatively:
    - 1 byte = 8 bits
    - 1 kikibyte (KiB) = 1024 bytes
    - 1 mebibyte (MiB) = 1024 kikibytes
    - 1 gibiyte (GiB) = 1024 mebibytes
    - 1 tebibyte (TiB) is 1024 gibibytes


*Alternate Number Base*

Important note: when you talk about binary you use the prefix 0b before the number and when you use hexa, use 0x before the number

-Binary: use base of two
    2⁰ = 1
    2¹ = 2
    2² = 4
    2³ = 8
    2⁴ = 16
    2⁵ = 32
    2⁶ = 64
    2⁷ = 128
    2⁸ = 256
    2⁹ = 512
    and so on... If you have trouble with what a power mean: https://youtu.be/zdu8dII7zRE?feature=shared

    You can use a table to convert from binary to decimal -> please refer to /Images/table_binary_number.png in the repo 
    For decimal to binary just use an online converter tool because convering by hand will take more time than just taking a calculator or an online tool

-Hexadecimal: use base of 16
    Counting in hexadecimal goes like this: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
    16⁰ = 1
    16¹ = 16
    16² = 256
    16³ = 4096
    16⁴ = 65536
    Hexadecimal is widely used because you can represent big number quickly as shown above
    Converting from Hexadecimal work pretty much like binary but don't forget A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15
    So for 0x2B:
        - 2*16 + 11*1 = 32 + 11 = 43
    Also same as binary to decimal, is faster to use an online converter tool or a calculator for converting

-ASCII
    Ascii table or other like Unicode permits to encode binary number and hexadecimal number to characters that are drawn to the screen
    You can look up on internet or alternatively here -> to see what is look like
