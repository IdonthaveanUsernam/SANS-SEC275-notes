*Introduction to Programming*

What is a computer program ?

A computer program is a set of instructions we write for the computer in an understadable way for him.

-Programming Languages: There are tons of programming language but all have the same goal,
give instructions to the computer. That code we write is calle source code.

There are two way of converting the code that is human-friendly to machine code (binary) that is understandable for 
the computer. Compiled and Interpreted

Compiling is the process of taking the source code and converting it once into machine code which ouput to a new executable program
For Interpreted, an Interpreter is loaded into memory then a process is started to load your souce code file and translate it into an
intermediate representation for the processor to execut each instruction directly it converts the source code on the fly ever time you want to run it
and don't produce a program file

1. Write Source Code                                1. Write Source Code
   (e.g., main.c)                                      (e.g., script.py)
        â†“                                                   â†“
2. Compile Code (via Compiler)                    2. Run Code (via Interpreter)
   - Full code is translated at once                - Code is read and executed line-by-line
   - Errors are reported before execution           - Errors appear as the code runs
        â†“                                                   â†“
3. Generate Executable                            3. Immediate Execution
   - Creates a machine code file                    - Executes each instruction directly
        â†“                                                   â†“
4. Run Program                                    4. Continue Execution
   - Fast execution                                 - Slower, but flexible
        â†“                                                   â†“
5. Output                                         5. Output

-Environnment and choices:

Choosing a language depends on several factors like you'r need the type of architecture you want to deploy the flexibility..
