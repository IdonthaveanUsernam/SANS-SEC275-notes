*Introduction to Programming*

What is a computer program ?

A computer program is a set of instructions we write for the computer in an understadable way for him.

-Programming Languages: There are tons of programming language but all have the same goal,
give instructions to the computer. That code we write is calle source code.

There are two way of converting the code that is human-friendly to machine code (binary) that is understandable for 
the computer. Compiled and Interpreted

Compiling is the process of taking the source code and converting it once into machine code which ouput to a new executable program
For Interpreted, an Interpreter is loaded into memory then a process is started to load your souce code file and translate it into an
intermediate representation for the processor to execut each instruction directly it converts the source code on the fly ever time you want to run it
and don't produce a program file

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Write Source Code                                1. Write Source Code
   (e.g., main.c)                                      (e.g., script.py)
        â†“                                                   â†“
2. Compile Code (via Compiler)                    2. Run Code (via Interpreter)
   - Full code is translated at once                - Code is read and executed line-by-line
   - Errors are reported before execution           - Errors appear as the code runs
        â†“                                                   â†“
3. Generate Executable                            3. Immediate Execution
   - Creates a machine code file                    - Executes each instruction directly
        â†“                                                   â†“
4. Run Program                                    4. Continue Execution
   - Fast execution                                 - Slower, but flexible
        â†“                                                   â†“
5. Output                                         5. Output

-Environnment and choices:

Choosing a language depends on several factors like you'r need the type of architecture you want to deploy the flexibility..

Low-level vs high-level

Programing language are seprated into low-level and high level categories

High-level: handles much of the details of hows processor does things automatically for the programmer but are less prone to errors
Low-level: Leaves more of the details up to the programmer and give much more control and allow a skilled programmer to create more efficient programm but give so much
control that is easy to make a mistake and take much more line of code than high level

-Python: High level programming language usually used as an interpreted language

-C: low-level and it's a general purpose programming language and it's the father of other programming language

Running program:

-Interpreted program
example with pyton: python hello-world.py -> python is the interpreter and hello-world.py is the source code

-Compiled program
example with C: gcc -o hello-world hello-world.c
               chmod +x hello-world                
              ./hello-world
GCC read the code from hello-world.c and produce an executable named hello-world

*Definitions*

Programming: Planning, desing, coding, testing, deploying ...
Coding: It's what you do when you're typing code to create your program
Code: is what you write using a programming language while coding
Script: Controls a program or perhaps many programs. 

-Python DATA

Print
Our first Python Program is to just ouput 'Hello, World!'
refer /code/hello.py

Note that comments are really useful to explain hard code or even make not for yourself

-Variables
A variable is some data with a name you give it.
Variable is a box with a label. It could contain anything you like you can add or remove content from the box or rename the label 
refer to code/variables.py

Naming variables:

Some rules
-Variables names in python can contain only alphanumerics + underscores
-You can't start a variable name with a number
-Usually an underscore is used when you want to make a space
-Variable name are case sensitive: chocolate != Chocolate

Variable types: every variables has its own type that decide what kind of data it can store

-string: A serie of characters
-integers: whole number positive or negative
-float: number with a decimal point like 56.484674441
-boolean: True or False or 1(True) and 0(False) for some programming language 

Pyton is dynamically typed programming language this means you don't have to specify what type of variable is whe, you create it
refer to code/type_variables.py

-Strings
In python anything insique " " or ' ' is a string 

Escape characters: In python if you want to print out for example 'That's mine' you will get an error because
python think that the string terminate at ' befor the s but find characters after. So you need a way to handle situations like this
with the escape characters \ 'That\'s mine'. escape character tells our program that the next character should be interpreted as part of
the string

-Concatenating strings: In python, you can combien mutiple strings togehter into one

refer to code/concatenating_string.py

-Adding whitespace

You can withespace like a tab with \t or \n for adding a new line

refer code/whitespace.py

-Stripping whitespace
you can remove whitespace to the left of you're string with lstrip()
you can remove whitespace to the right of you're string with rstrip()
you can remove whitespace from both side with strip()


*Numbers*

-Integers: are whole numbers, can be positive or negative

refer to code/integers.py

note that in python the order of operations are conserved

-Floats: number that contain decimal

refer to code/float.py

-Booleans: type of data that is only able to be in one of two states true (1) or false (0)

refer to code/bool.py

*String Formatting*

Another way of formatting string rather than concatenation is to use format string

refer to code/string_formatting.py

*Everything is data*

-Characters are data

character like space A,b,Z can be represented as integer from the ASCII table (you can search online for the complete ASCII table)

refer to code/data.py

*Lists and Tuples*

when you need a collection of items, you can create list

-Lists
refer to code/list.py

You can also modify a list, adding content, removing content, sort the list...

refer to code/modifying_list.py

-Tuples are like list but there are immutable that mean a tuple can't be modified

refert to code/tuples.py

-Dictionaries: like a list but allow us to associate information together in helpful pair called 'key-value' pairs

refer to code/dictionarie.py


*Python - Logic*

-Functions: function allow to split code into smaller chunk that can be called again anytime by it's name
You can even give paramaters to the function so the function can take you're data (arguments) and treat it wihtin the function 
code. Functions can also return values. With functions, you can take a serie of small pieces and build a powerful and complex
system

refer to code/function.py

*Conditionals*

Programs can make decisions based on data, that decision is called a conditional, which mean we check if a Specified condition is met.
The return value is typically True or False and that value help decide what to do next.

'==' for example check for equality

refer to code/equality.py


-If conditions

For example, you want to run a part of code only if a certain condition is met like a user who want to register but only if
the user don't exist. You can use If conditions

refer to code/if.py

-Comparaison operators aside from "==" there are other comparaisons operrators
"==" Equal to
"<=" less than or equal to
">=" Greter than or equal to
"<" Less than
">" Greater than

You can even use conditionals with lists and checks multiple conditions

refer to code/conditionals.py


-else and elif

Sometimes we don't want to do anything if a condition isn't met we can use else
elif is like else if

refer to code/else.py


-For 

'for' loop allow to run code at each iteration
you can iterate through a list for example or maybe a dictionary. But in case you don't have a list or a dictionary, you can use range() function

see code/for.py
